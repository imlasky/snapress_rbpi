## instructions (raspberry pi)

1. if you're using a raspberry pi, get that setup [[instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#install-using-imager)]
2. once you reach the settings page (below), click "Edit Settings" and do the following:
    * keep the raspberry.local
    * set the username and password (i'll be using *snapress* for the username for the rest of this)
    * add your wifi (if you have the nano, it has to be the 2.4ghz since it doesn't support 5g)
    * click select locale settings
